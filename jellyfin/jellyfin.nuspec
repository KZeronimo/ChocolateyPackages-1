## The Free Software Media System

Jellyfin is the Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. There are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas.

### What is Jellyfin?
Jellyfin is a free program that lets you collect, control, and stream all your favourite media.

### Movies
Holds your entire movie collection, and displays a beautiful collection of posters.


### TV Shows
Collect your TV Shows, and have them automatically organized by season.


### Music
Enjoy your own music collection. Make playlists, and listen on the go.


### Live TV &amp; DVR
Watch Live TV and set automatic recordings to expand your media library.

### Your media, for wherever you are.
Jellyfin works on major web browsers, right now. Chromecast is supported when using Google Chrome (desktop) or Android.

There is currently a beta for Android, Android TV and Fire TV apps. Other apps for other platforms are in development and are on their way.

### No centralized tracking. It's your data.
Jellyfin has no built-in tracking, and no central servers collecting your data. We believe in keeping our software open and transparent for everyone to see it, use it, and build on it.

### Free Software, and growing.
Jellyfin is Free Software, licensed with the GPL.
